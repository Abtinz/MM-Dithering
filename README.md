# Ordered Dithering and Floyd-Stienberg

In this project, two famous image compression and size reduction algorithms from the family of dithering algorithms have been implemented.</br>
</br><b>Ordered Dithring and Grayscale Image:</b></br>
in this section grayscale image is made using YUV constant coefficients and calculating the original image brightness levels. then order ditherd image is created by dithering matrix and thresolding in image processing section.
